This **Jupyter Notebook project** explores **51,717 restaurants in India** using the **Zomato dataset**. The analysis focuses on **customer ratings, restaurant types, pricing, and geographic trends** to uncover key insights about the restaurant industry.  

## Summary
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on 51,717 Indian restaurants using the Zomato dataset.
- Investigated restaurant success factors by analyzing ratings, votes, online ordering, table booking, and cuisine trends.
